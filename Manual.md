# How to Play #

Clicking on a square will rotate its contents, a left click performs an anticlockwise rotation and a right click performs a clockwise rotation. Middle-clicking marks a square (which might be used, for example, if you know for certain its orientation is correct).

You win when every terminal and wire is connected to the main server.

On some settings, the board will wrap around.

# Compilation #

Just type "make".

Older versions were written in Eiffel. Their Makefiles were written for [SmallEiffel (now known as SmartEiffel)](http://smarteiffel.loria.fr/), but they also contain a "netwalk.make" script that compiles the C code generated by SmallEiffel.

# Installation #

The bundled config file and fonts should be fine. Edit "~/.netwalk/config" in Linux (and "config" in Windows) to change default settings.
