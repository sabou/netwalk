# Introduction #
NetWalk is a puzzle game where the object is to connect every terminal to the main server. (Or you could also imagine them to be water mains, electricity cables, phone lines, etc.) Clicking on a square will rotate its contents, a left click performs an anticlockwise rotation and a right click performs a clockwise rotation.

There's at least one [Win95/98 version of this game](http://www.gamos.ru/eng/games/netwalk.html) available, and also [QNetWalk](http://qt.osdn.org.ua/qnetwalk.html) which looks a lot nicer than mine (though it probably does not have a cool victory animation!). The Linux game KPlumber and Windows clone [Linkz](http://www.vanderlee.com/software_linkz.html) are very similar.

I don't know who invented this game. I'd like to know, as when I first came across it, I spent a lot of time playing it.

[Ben Lynn](http://cs.stanford.edu/~blynn/) wrote the original code and is still maintaining it. Dave Dodge sent in a patch adding several features such as cell marking, giant boards and edge square highlights. Thanks to many others for suggestions, bug reports and minor patches.
